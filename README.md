# SudokuGA
Using genetic algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles.

This project tries to solve sudoku puzzles using genetic algorithms.


# Genetic Algorithm Framework

The project is written in C# and contains a generic framework for genetic algorithms which applications can use.
It also contains a simple console application which uses the GA framework to solve sudoku puzzles.

The framework itself uses C# tasks for multithreading, so the fitness of multiple chromosones are calculated in parallel.

All sources are fully documented so it should be fairly easy to get started. 


## Building

Simply download the sources, open the solution in visual studio and run it
